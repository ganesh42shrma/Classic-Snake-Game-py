# Classic-Snake-Game-py
This Python project is a classic Snake Game implemented using Turtle graphics. The Snake Game is a nostalgic and iconic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food, and the objective is to avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the game borders.
